# Corporate-Data-Center-Network-Design-and-Security


The data center is designed using a three-tier hierarchical model to ensure optimal performance, scalability, and manageability. The architecture consists of the following layers:

Core Layer
Acts as the high-speed backbone of the network, interconnecting all parts of the infrastructure. This layer uses powerful Cisco switches and routers with redundant links to eliminate any single points of failure and ensure high availability.

Distribution (Aggregation) Layer
Positioned between the core and access layers, this layer enforces network policies, performs inter-VLAN routing, and filters traffic. It aggregates connections from access layer switches and forwards them to the core.

Access Layer
Provides direct network access to servers, storage devices, and the management team. This layer is the entry point for devices within the data center to connect to the network.

Security Considerations
Redundant links and devices at the core prevent single points of failure.

ACLs and firewalls at the distribution layer enforce access control and traffic filtering.

Port security, MAC filtering, and 802.1X at the access layer enhance endpoint protection.

VLAN segmentation isolates traffic between departments or services to limit the blast radius of potential threats.
